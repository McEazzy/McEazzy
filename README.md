- 👋 Hi, I’m @McEazzy
- 👀 I’m interested in developing and improving software projects to automate works and efficiently manage resources such as time, users, distribution, etc... 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning on Github itself and languages such as JavaScript, .NET, C++, C# and Machine Learning in my spare time.
- 🏆 I'm quite experienced in coding with Python, Java and C language, with fluent understanding in Data Structure and Algorithm, Object Oriented, Sofware Design Pattern, and Software Unit Testing.  Directly develop a couple projects both from scrach and existing code base incorporation for uni and team.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on coding projects if my skill and tech stack fits. Keen on learning any new and relevant tech frameworks.

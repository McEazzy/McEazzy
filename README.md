- 👋 Hi, I’m @McEazzy
- 👀 I’m interested in creating new software projects to automate works and efficiently manage resources such as time, users, distribution, etc... 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning on Github itself and languages such as JavaScript, Python, .NET, C++, C# and Machine Learning in my spare time.
- 🏆 I'm quite experienced in coding with Java and C language, with fluent understanding in Data Structure and Algorithm, Object Oriented, Sofware Design Pattern, and Software Unit Testing. Also, I've learned UI/UX design through team-developing SafeNav-19 - a mobile Covid Navigation app for users to conveniently avoid hotspots. I've also developed multiple apps and games on Android from scratch utilising various SQL database library integration.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on coding projects for my own or yours if my skill and tech stack fits. I'm also keen on learning any coding framework or languages.

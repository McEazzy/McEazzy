- 👀 I’m interested in creating new software projects to automate works and efficiently manage resources such as time, users, distribution, etc... 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning on android development, databases, operating system, github itself and languages such as Java, Python, C, C++, C#
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on coding projects for my own or yours if my skill and tech stack fits. I'm also keen on learning any coding framework or languages.
